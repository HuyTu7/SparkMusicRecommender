# Music Recommender System using Apache Spark and Python

Create a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).

### Tools: 
Spark and Collaborative Filtering Technique.

### Datasets: 
More information about the datasets can be looked into [here](DatasetsINFO.txt)

### Solutions:
The final solution is composed of:
+ processing the data to be in the appropriate formats.
+ breaking them down randomly to training, testing, and validation sets
+ apply the predicting method on traininng dataset to create the model
+ predicting/recommending the artists for each users on testing sets
+ evaluating the model by comparing with the user's artists
